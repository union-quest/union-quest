# Union Quest

## A new fully on-chain MMORPG based around credit, built atop of Union, hosted on IPFS & utilising a subgraph for data.



In-game stats
Users' credit scores can be translated to in-game stats. This creates a symbiotic relationship between Union⇔UnionQuest:
Gamers use Union to get an advantage in the game.
Union power users play the game because they start with a free advantage.
 
Lending as a key part of the economy
The in-game economy should provide as much opportunity for lending as possible and be super integrated with Union. 
Renting BS one-use items for boss fights.
“lend this player money” button in-app
Credit limit-gated quests
Quests that only unlock globally after enough TVL in the protocol
Using Union also saves us from writing the code ourselves and also saves users the time of vouching again etc.


DeFi-pilling gamers
If the game is fun+rewarding on its own, regular gamers will want to play it. By first requiring them to register with Union, we can “sneak” them into DeFi in a fun way. Like a Trojan horse.

Built in social network
People usually lend to their friends. We can create a “friends list” based on which people users trust.
